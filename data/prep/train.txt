altogether rather design activity guided sense elegance solutions structural engineering problems usually greatly underdetermined many possible solutions particular problem bridging particular river therefore expert designers restrict attention designs interaction forces easy see design looks unbalanced forces unbalanced design looks stable stable general principle designs look good will also

lakota sioux country well parents lived even diverse range indian reservations experience direct result living parents get lot information first hand cases second hand father income figures indians somewhat misleading mostly really hard proper accounting effective income true indians live genuine poverty typically consequence previous poor decisions made tribe something impressed upon primary problem accounting tribal entity exists separately individuals typically indian corporation one type another member tribe owns single share details share becomes active varies tribe tribe tribes dividend paid tribal members corporation usually tune k per person depending tribe dividend money comes number places primary sources federal gov t various businesses assets owned indian corporation understand couple things first great many indian tribes run purely communist enterprises everyone gets check share matter one biggest problems caused high unemployment often tribal members happy take dividend work dividend receive corporation often constitutes sole income government accounting purposes unfortunately support type economics one works ve sell useful assets maintain dividends many tribes genuinely living poverty run things sell yet nobody works one ironies many reservations tribes still assets burn many people working stores actually poor white folk indians second even though tribe members get cash dividend also receive enormous range benefits perks indian corporation tune tens thousands dollars per person annually benefits perks talking kinds things ordinary american receives either employer government pointed many indian corporations ineptly run mostly provide sinecures indians minority smartly managed hire non indian business executives good credentials run business divisions example haida corporation less tribal shareholders billions dollars assets various corporations gross revenues million range growing yet dividend paid strictly controlled k particular case engaged practice waiting couple decades drawing money assets granted led intelligent investment use don t eat seed corn actually managed grow stash contrast couple islands another tribe people net loss million annually iirc regularly endowed federal government several billions dollars valuable assets particular tribe modest income theory actual expenditures per person annually hundreds thousands dollars many borrow money future income incidentally particular case people working frequently pull hundred thousand dollars year much goes back tribal corporation rather pockets somewhat annoying federal government semi regularly grants valuable assets tribes ve burned ones previously given feasible typically selling assets american foreign companies cycle continues primary problem tribes problems nutshell thoroughly pathological culture society women reach age without getting pregnant incest rape gross promiscuity rampant inbreeding heavy drug abuse pregnancy environmental factors created tribes substantial fraction tribe literally mentally retarded many thoughtful intelligent tribe members leave reservation earliest opportunity mostly avoid problems mentioned one reservation parents lived hiv infection rate many societies thoroughly corrupt administration law arbitrary capricious judges courts police etc short many tribes still hanging together shambles become pathological societies ever seen anywhere legal status really aren t many consequences behavior many things tell ve seen probably believe unless d seen always good people tribes gotten point losers idiots outnumber good guys fair margin many times mobocracy typically btw white folk wants experience overt aggressive racism minority place rule law fiction police openly thugs try living one messed indian reservations will give interesting perspective things two real situations find reasonably prosperous indians first rare case tribes run disciplined intelligent people managed assets wisely second tribe dispersed assimilated part even maintain tribal identity cases tribal leaders reject insular behavior tends lead pathological cases mentioned indians often quite wealthy technically lot money spent tribe per capita actual reportable income quite high consider many living entirely tribal dole just peculiar economic structure lend well ordinary economic analysis merely looking nominal income poverty social cultural nature economic original point tangent one thing always interested concept quasi tribal corporate socialism many indian tribes implement type corporate socialism mind bogglingly bad execution use structure accident history anything interested smartly managed ones surprisingly well long run like family corporation writ large seems future familial ties will increasingly voluntary general concept may merit general western society serving create facsimile biological extended family included dynamics arbitrary set self selecting individuals damn long late lot longer james rogers pm john hall wrote understand huge difference native americans speak english home don t figures separate hand though american indians us pop whole families poverty persons
