run warning work nicely multi threading temp file names made less likely coincide name file created user take form unison tmp added new command gtk user interface pressing f causes unison start new update detection phase using paths just paths detected changed yet marked successfully completed use command quickly restart unison just set paths still needing attention previous run made ignorecase preference user visible changed initialization code can manually set true even neither host running windows may useful e g using unison running unix system fat volume mounted small improvements bug fixes errors preference files now generate fatal errors rather warnings startup time e can t go also fixed bug preventing warnings appearing text ui users running unsuspectingly garbage prefs files

files prefix excluded scanning preference files rsync instructions send directly instead first marshaled won t try forever get fingerprint continuously changing file unison will give certain number

backward compatibility old names still work mentioned manual temp files created diff merge commands now named prepending new prefix file name rather appending suffix avoid confusing diff merge programs depend suffix guess type file contents now set keepalive option server socket make sure server times communication link unexpectedly broken bug fixes updating small files unison now closes destination file file permissions properly updated file behind followed link several small fixes changes since major windows performance improvement ve added preference fastcheck makes unison look file s creation time last modified time check whether changed result huge speedup checking updates large replicas switch set unison will use file creation times pseudo inode numbers scanning windows replicas updates instead reading full contents every file may cause unison miss propagating update create time modification time length file unchanged update easy achieve can done however unison will never overwrite update change replica since always safe check updates just propagating change thus reasonable use switch time occasionally run unison fastcheck set false worried unison may overlooked update warning change yet thoroughly field tested set fastcheck preference pay careful attention unison new functionality centralized backups merging version incorporates two pieces major new functionality implemented sylvain roy summer internship penn centralized backup facility keeps full backup selected files replica merging feature allows unison invoke external file merging tool resolve conflicting changes individual files centralized backups o unison now maintains full backups last synchronized versions files replica function backups usual sense common version invoking external merge programs o backed files stored directory unison backup host name directory can changed setting environment variable unisonbackupdir o predicate backup controls files actually backed giving preference backup path causes backing files o files added backup directory whenever unison updates archive means unison reconstructs archive scratch e g upgrade archive files manually deleted files will backed otherwise file will backed first time unison propagates update o preference backupversions controls many previous versions file kept default e last synchronized version plus one backup o backward compatibility backups preference also still supported backup now preferred o ok manually delete files backup directory throw away directory unison uses files anything important checks fingerprint matches one expects merging o user interfaces offer new merge command invoked pressing m changed file selected o actual merging performed external program preferences merge merge control program invoked backup exists file see backup preference merge preference used purpose otherwise merge used cases value preference string representing command passed shell invoke merge program within string special substrings current current new old may appear point unison will substitute follows invoking command current replaced name local copy file current replaced name temporary file

external merge programs o backed files stored directory unison backup host name directory can changed setting environment variable unisonbackupdir o predicate backup controls files actually backed giving preference backup path causes backing files o files added backup directory whenever unison updates archive means unison reconstructs archive scratch e g upgrade archive files manually deleted

backup o backward compatibility backups preference also still supported backup now preferred o ok manually delete files backup directory throw away directory unison uses files anything important checks fingerprint matches one expects merging o user interfaces offer new merge command invoked pressing m changed file selected o actual merging performed external program preferences merge merge
